- after my last espresso, clean me light came on..
- need to replace the water filter
- need to descale
  - every 3 weeks?

- got into cleaning the coffee machine
  - the instructions are really confusing between the quick start guide and the full manual on how and how often
    - vinegar every month?
    - full descale every 6 months?
    - should you take the water filter out?
      - genuine sage/breville cleaner or caffetto?
    - [Seatle Coffee Gear Descaling BE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf04CYUFw3o=)
  - (i seem to recall i had some trouble with the instructions when it came to inital setup too)
  - three runs to get the grouphead cleaned (tablet gone)
    - water filter change schedule?
    - avcalc schedule?
    - grouphead gasket?
  - seems you descal the steam wand anyway, so may as well use it
  - vinegar descale? ... stinks
  - steam wand went EVERYWHERE (see the seatle gear video above)
      - should I use a separate schedule for steam wand cleaning?
      - (ive been avoiding the steam want to save on cleaning and descaling)

- Need to get into the timing of Espresso
  - 25-30seconds from when to when?
  - what does the BE Book say?
  - i have high pressures, but low times
  - pre-infusion time ?
  - take a video and then analyze it
