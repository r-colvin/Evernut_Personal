chat with tim (messenger & quick call)
- projects - i will have two MAJOR projects which encompas the learnings and training i want :) (CE will be a big help; looked up the CM3 IO board schematic - they didn't help much )
  - notetaking app - ball plank with Tim
  - I/O board (this should be one of my major projects - imagine what you would learn)
    - does he know scott williams? does he have any other design engineers to talk to?
      - they build on Pi compute modules
    - Telstra/Thales
    - when will the S19Y01/Y02 be public? is this a suitable target? or the RPi3? imx6rex? (use that as a way to learn iMX/high speed design as well...)
    - the s19y01 is the best candidate, but needs the ability to talk to others
- keep catching up
- just chatting (VBCU)

- AD2 was delivered last night to george
- pinged scott on CE asking about the webinar
- pinged CE: for the Certifications & requirements when importing from China course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/certifications-requirements-when-importing-from-china/)
- need to ping CE
  - the power swap project (will it do what i want)
    - would need to go to journeyman for a month; take the course and swap back
  - the fedevel project for smps (which is board layout mostly)
  - "real world" design work (do you keep libraries of designs and reuse - like for smps)
    - the diference between lab and real world engineering when emc etc is required
  - it's so easy to fall down the rabbit hole in trying to understand how this circuit (the S19Y02 EVB power supply) is designed and why
    - buck-buck converters
    - common-mode noise
    - diferential noise.. (ferrite beads) which leads to inductor theory and filter circuits
