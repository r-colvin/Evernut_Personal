- trying to sync 1Password to the Mac; main/primary vault worked, but secondary doesn't... should merge them perhaps
- sync phone to MBA
- disable sync on phone and resync to Maac Mini
- sync the Seconday vault to the USB key on the MBA then move to Mini (as per https://support.1password.com/new-device/)

- didnt work, as the instructions assume you are starting from scratch... i can create a new vault and then sync the opvault to it; need the password for that vault...
- give up! keep the two vauls on the MBA and the phone (the MBA wont be in sync now)... sort it later - i have my logins on the mini now at least
  - solution will be to merge the two vauls i think; it's only 12 items
  - remember when 1Password was good?

- moved the meeting wit Grant to Friday @ 8:30
