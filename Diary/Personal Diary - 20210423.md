chatting with Tim, pitching the evernuts idea to him
- need to follow up

- picked up the parcels from Amazon
  - the organiser is almost perfect for my needs, a few things id fix/change - might see if i can build a cover for it so it's flat? (or at least fill in some holes - lets see when the AD2 arrives how it fits though)
  - initially it stank... had to remove it, clean it and air out the office
  - i didn't buy keychains... just the inserts... d'oh!

- gardens are going well; removed the soil sensors and moved the plants (herbs) to the kitchen; the smultron/lettuce will need to be replanted soon - though i put them outside for the weekend and i dont think they liked the cold; ebbe's tomato isnt happy - need to do something there i think
