- thinking about picking up the kids
  - i got mixed up yesterday, not being used to having meetings and things to do, i just accepted the meeting and expected it not to clash with pickup!
  - we need to plan and sync pickups in the morning - dropoff is normally ok for me, but pickup has to be worked around work again
  - we should be happy with NA not wanting me to come to meetings and do things, it meant i was always free to pick up the kids on time and now that im busy, hopefully corona is coming to an end and the weather is getting better so there is flexibility in pickup
