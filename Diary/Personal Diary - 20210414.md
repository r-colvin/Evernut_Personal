- chat with AG re: new role and what I'm doing now
  - showed him the garden, said it was not a big leap from the connected bar

- ####[Connected Bar](#PROJECTS:)
  - IoT Beer -> VBCU? Afterwork? Beer Tasting? Virtual Beer Festival (MBCV)? Talk to Craft Beer Channel? (marketing like Pizza with Scott Wiener)
