- i feel really cluttered in my brain right now... its chaotic and i don't feel on top of anything... i feel like i am jumping from task to task, constantly switching and trying to stay afloat. I feel like there is no predictability in my work - so any attempt at planning is somewhat futile. I think a large part of that is that i am trying to start in a new team, that no task is particularly mine... and im trying to sync with everyone - but in starting up, i am trying to involve myself in as much as possible, and everyone is trying to involve me. We, as a group are also just starting out - and as a company in general there is very little structure or cohesive direction (there is so much overlap in different groups just doing their own thing with no sync on our roadmap - its crazy - and am i the only one who sees it?)

when things are most chaotic, the need for organisation is at its most important, but its also when its the hardest to stay on top; you make one shortcut, then another, and before you know it, your in total chaos.. in the weeds... and its a negative spiral - you duplicate tasks because you're not sure if you have written it down, or got it into a state where you can action it.

Chaos tends to breed chaos then.... I think Tuva is feeling this a wee bit as well... the inability to plan a day is also something that tends to be hard... I would love to sit down in the morning, with my coffee and look at the day, make a plan of what needs to be done... now occasionally something will come up that is not planned, and you adjust - but it can sometimes become the rule and not the exception.

i am, right now, walking around thinking about all the things i need to do.. so i write a list... and then it gets thrown in a backlog, and im up to my ears in tasks... which causes stress and a feeling of chaos... so it continues.

I love my job, but i want more structure... i want the ability to work a task, without more things being added in. Though having said that, i am also aware that curiosity is something that drives me - unanswered questions, things i dont know... technical challenges is what motivates me. And so that tends to bring more work and tasks.

for me, there is no clear line between work and private - thing i enjoy doing for a hobby is what i do for work... so that in itself causes its own issues in creating work, and driving new taks or questions.

Right now, in the current situation, i dont feel my system is up to it - i feel like i am spending much more time doing admin than actually working... and that is leading to a sense of frustration. I expect that the state the office is in right now, is driving that somewhat as well - i tend to feel much better when i have a clean area to work; the stack of postits on my desk was causing me a lot of stress... at least having them logged someone was better; definitely though, when i dont take care of things immediately, thats when i feel worse. But, there must be a better way ... a tool that can handle this... though to be fair, what I have now works mostly well; it falls down mostly in dealing with notes taken when im away from the desk...

what i really want is....
- to be able to plan a day's work; have a clear list of tasks - view the top-level tasks only, the sub-tasks, notes, questions - next steps, APs etc are hidden (unless they are coming due)
- i want to know, quickly where im at - if i sit down at the desk and start to work, i should know immediately what to do
- i don't want to walk away from the desk with things open - i don't want to leave things open for too long; if i need to make a todo, i should be able to do it FAST and it's done
- if im away from the desk, i should be able to quickly make notes - when i come back to my desk, that might be a task to do when i work on that particular project (bring in and expand the notes from before - review and re-read)
- what ever im doing, there should be minimal overhead - look at my coffee diary, its important to me, but so much work, so i cut corners...

now here is a great example... i have in front of me three postits
- today's task list, something are closed off
- 2x notes planning tomorrow
in one of the notes it says
  "Tuva Blog -> write a blog first -> understand what exists first"
this is saying "I have an open meeting (to be set still) with Tuva to talk about writing content; but i should write a blog post to show first - but before i do that i need to understand what exists already as well as understand the material and prepare"... so a quick reminder to follow up has so many sub tasks ... how do you capture that? well obviously you have the task "Meet with Tuva to talk blog posts" and you have the sub tasks / pre-reqs
