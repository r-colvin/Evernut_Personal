- Tim contacted me on LinkedIn regarding a job at watt - watchers; need to sync up (chatting on Messenger; Grant (his boss) pinged me on LinkedIn)
  - never want to say no, but at the same time, there are a few warning bells
    - startup & job security
    - tims current opinions and stress levels
    - remote to aus?
